   \abstract{In this project, a control system for lights was created.
   The sensors and dimmers use a mesh network to communicate and keep a constant
   level of illumination, regardless of external disturbances such as a sudden
   cloud blocking external sunlight.}

	\section{Concept}
	
	Our idea is to control lights using dimmers and light sensors.

   The project concept was chosen to make maximal use of our teams experience
   in power electronics, automatic control and network algorithms.

	The sensors and dimmers communicate with radio over a mesh network.
	There is also a possibility to add a user interface over the network to control
	the brightness.
	
	Should the room get brighter or darker from sunlight or other illumination,
	the lights should be adjusted to compensate for this.
	
	\section{Primary goals}

   The primary goals were
	
	\begin{itemize}
		\item To control the brightness of a 230V light bulb with a microcontroller.
		\item To measure the amount of light in a room with a microcontroller.
		\item To communicate data between the microcontrollers over a mesh network.
		\item To make the system capable to compensate for changes in illumination.
		\item To control the system with a user interface node, also containing
		a microcontroller.
	\end{itemize}
	
	\section{Secondary goals}
   Additionally, we put up some secondary goals:
	\begin{itemize}
		\item To have several lamps and sensors
		\item To automate calibration i.e., what lamp affects what sensor
	\end{itemize}

   \section{Hardware design}
   As we had previous experience in our team of the nRF24L01+ radio module from
   Nordic Semiconductor, it was chosen as a base for the mesh network.

   We chose to dim the lights with a triac.
